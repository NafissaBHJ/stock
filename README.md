## What it is about ?

I created this project for testing/experimenting (with) Fluent UI as well as Sqflite for windows .

Before you go through the codebase I want to mention a few points that you may consider:

- The architecture of the app is  base on Suragch's architecture used in this blog post [https://suragch.medium.com/flutter-state-management-for-minimalists-4c71a2f2f0c1]

- The state management is accomplished with getIt used in the above blog post as well .
